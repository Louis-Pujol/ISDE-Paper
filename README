This folder contains code to reproduce experiments presented in the paper ISDE : Independence Structure Density Estimation. It contains three notebooks :


- Synthetic data.ipynb: to reproduce expermients of section 4.1
- Real data - loglikelihood.ipynb : to reproduce experiments of section 4.2.1
- Qualitative analysis.ipynb : to reproduce experiments of section 4.2.2

To be executed it requires the following packages :
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- PuLP (https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/)
- pyKeOps (https://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/python/installation.html)
